## üíº Experience

I started to get involved in web development in 2017. At first, I worked as a freelancer.
During this period, I independently learned the basics of `Vanilla JavaScript`, `HTML` and
`SCSS` development. I also had experience in SEO optimization of the site - SSR, site speed
optimization, `OpenGraph`, `JSON-LD`, `Twitter cards`, etc.

In 2019, I got a part-time job as a mentor at an online web development school. I taught two
courses - development in basic JavaScript and TypeScript + React. And I am proud to say that
all the students who passed the exam did it perfectly.

In 2020, I got a job as a FrontEnd developer. Then I got the experience of corporate
development and teamwork. During this period, my main technology stack was a `React` +
`TypeScript` + `MobX` + `TypeDI`. And also then I started using MVVM and DI patterns. I was 
the most proactive developer in the team and always offered my ideas about improving the code 
and optimizing the site. Often these ideas were brought to life.

In August 2021, I became FrontLead and also began to partially perform the duties of TeamLead.
From the FrontLead position, I was responsible for all the work of the Front-end development
department of our team and also be a mentor for frontend interns. From the position of TeamLead,
I was responsible for the introduction of new employees into the project, the organization of
work on the interaction of our team with other teams from the company and assistance in the
preparation of product documents.

      For some time, I enthusiastically studied machine learning and neural networks. I have
      taken several courses, including several courses from Stanford University. Also, a neural
      network was used in my final qualifying work. Therefore, I can say that I am familiar
      with <code>TensorFlow</code>, <code>Keras</code>, <code>NumPy</code>,
      <code>Scikit Learn</code> and other related technologies at least at a basic level. I also
      have experience in time series analysis.

      Since I have a higher education in the field of information security and currently work
      for a company related to this field, I am well versed in it. Especially on the border of
      cyber-security communication and websites. I am familiar with the concepts of SQL
      injection, XSS, CSRF and others.
